		  <h2>Sponsorship</h2>
		  

<p>
Bristol is this years proud host of the Plone conference 2010. We have managed to secure a 
fantastic city centre venue and have an exciting programme of events and talks planned.
</p>

<p> 
The annual Plone conference is only made possible with the help and support of the community 
and sponsors of the event. We hope to make this years conference one of the most comprehensive, 
remarkable gatherings of Plone followers to date but we need your support.
</p>

<p>
Sponsoring the Plone Conference 2010 would mean raising your profile with a highly motivated expert 
target group. Putting your name forward again as a sponsor of such an important event would 
consolidate your firm's position in the market and would confirm your credibility and reliability 
with Information and Communication Technology companies of national and international renown.
</p>

<p>
Sponsoring the Plone Conference would mean contributing to the growth of free software and 
stimulating the circulation of free software as a vehicle for the popularization of knowledge and 
understanding. It would mean moreover contributing to the diffusion of the Open Source culture, 
enhancing its value and potential and increasing the experience of each participant.
</p>

conference package through to smaller opportunities such as our supporting sponsorship.
