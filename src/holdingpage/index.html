                        Attendees can expect three full days of talks from both experienced Plone developers 
                        and those new to Plone, including an Open Space / Unconference day on the third day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aiming to promote Plone to the wider CMS / WCM community, this year's conference 
                        will also feature a related one-day event aimed at analysts and decision makers on the 
                        26th October. This mini-conference will showcase a number of case studies from 
                        successful Plone projects and the future roadmap for Plone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if that's not enough, we will also have two days of training and workshops before 
                        the conference for those new to Plone, or wanting to brush up on their skills. After the 
                        conference there will be two days of developer sprints where you will get the chance to 
                        work alongside some of the best brains in the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, it wouldn't be a proper Plone gathering without a bit of a party! This year's 
                        conference party will be held at a fantastic city centre venue, where we will be hosting 
                        a beer &amp; pie festival showcasing some of Bristol's tastiest local produce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More details regarding the conference will be posted on the site soon, including 
                        registration rates, accommodation and travel.  In the mean time more information can be found on <a href="http://plone.org/events/conferences/bristol-2010" title="Plone Conference 2010 - Plone.org" >plone.org</a>.
