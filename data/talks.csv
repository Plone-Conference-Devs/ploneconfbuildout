7/18/2011 4:04:12,Dan Jacka,"I've been building websites with Plone since 2008, mostly for large government agencies in New Zealand. I've presented at World Plone Day events.
",How to think in Plone (when those about you think in Drupal),"Where I work, most developers come to Plone from Drupal. To build really great websites they must let go of old idioms and learn to think in Plone. In this talk I will explain how to use the features of Plone that are most essential in solving your customers' problems. To better emphasize the mindset shift, I'll compare with equivalent approaches in Drupal.

There're two target audiences for this talk: 1) the small set of integrators taking this same journey between CMSes, and 2) the wider Plone community curious about how the Plone out-of-the-box experience compares to another CMS from an integrator's perspective.
","My Plone life began in 2008 when I was given a copy of Professional Plone Development and asked to build a site. Before then I'd been working with Drupal. As I progressed I found that the biggest challenge wasn't the technology itself, but learning which features were best for solving the content management problems of my customer. Now when I help colleagues learn Plone (often coming from Drupal), they run up against all the same problems. In this talk I aim to help others become productive with Plone faster, and to illustrate to longtime Plone devs the kind of problems new integrators can face.

First, some boundaries: this is not about Plone versus Drupal. I find such religious wars tiresome and unproductive. Also, I won't be describing every little useful add-on (though there are some fab ones out there). This is about the philosophy at the core of the system.

For those unfamiliar, Drupal is a PHP application that stores content in a SQL database. Every piece of content is a 'node', stored in the node table. Looking up a field on your custom content type sees the engine run JOIN queries keyed from the node ID of that particular piece of content. For integrators, Drupal core exposes 'hooks'. Name a function in your module appropriately and it'll be fired as a hook when the user requests a page.

The hooks system combined with lots of TTW configurability of nodes makes Drupal very malleable. It's like a block of clay: it changes shape even if you're only holding it! The ease with which you can bend it into shape is the biggest driver behind Drupal's success. But things can get messy fast.

Plone on the other hand is like a block of wood. It's solid and strong. If you want to make something from it you'll need decent tools; you'll need to know how to recognise the grain and how to plane with it, not against it; as your skills improve you'll learn when going against the grain can work. Oh, and watch out for the occasional knot...

Yes I know wood is implicitly a superior building material than clay. That's my bias showing through. But clay has its uses. Coating wood with clay is never a good idea though.

Heading deeper into specifics: databases. Being brutal, Drupal is a wrapper around a SQL database. That makes for a very low barrier for integrators wanting to get data out - it's just a SQL query away. The ZODB is conceptually harder. You can't get at any and every little piece of data from whereever you might be in the code. Core content fields are queried from the catalog. You may or may not want to do the same with custom fields, dependent on how widespread they are on your site and how expensive getting them from objects directly might be.

More database tips:
- Use AdvancedQuery for more sophisticated query logic e.g. I've used it to find content that provided *this* marker interface but not *that* marker interface.
- Check portal_purgepolicy. By default Plone keeps every version of content. Is that right for your site?
- Be careful, but .zexp files can be really useful e.g. when your client has entered data they want to keep into a throwaway database.
- Some CMSes will tolerate you installing, trying, then uninstalling products. You're asking for trouble, and Plone will let you know it. Only install on production if you're sure you want the product.
- Remember the direction rule: code goes from dev to production; data goes the opposite way. If you're copying dev databases to production you're doing it wrong.
- A useful habit to pick up is using a setuphandler for default and/or test content. See transmogrify.dexterity too.
- If you need to store relational data, it's ok to break out into a relational database. collective.table is an upcoming product that will make adding small sets of relational data very easy.

User-driven queries. When I first came to Plone from Drupal I thought Collections were a lot less powerful than Drupal Views. And they are. But I realised that's because Collections are a tool for content editors, whereas Drupal Views are for developers. Views are a UI for building very complex queries, which aligns with Drupal's philosophy of allowing integrators to build a custom site without writing code. I would like to see Collections gain a bit more Views-like power (e.g. sort order determined by multiple fields); hopefully that'll come after the new, much improved Collections UI in Plone 4.2.

After being brutal about Drupal being a SQL wrapper, it's time to be kind: the Taxonomy module is really, really good. Taxonomy is big in Drupal. It's one of the first features you come across. It's part of core and lots of modules use it as the base of their functionality. Taxonomy lets you - through the web - define controlled, flat or multi-level vocabularies and apply them to multiple content types. It's used for categorisation, but also for flagging special content e.g. a node may have the 'members only' term applied from the 'access level' vocabulary; this controls access via the 'Taxonomy Access Control' module (note this example also illustrates the crazy malleability of Drupal!).

Plone's equivalent is twofold: firstly, marking special content. This is absolutely one of my favourite things about Plone. Marker interfaces plus the Zope Component Architecture make all your client's niggly little special cases easy to write without compromising your nice, clean code. Just register a more specific adapter (probably a view or viewlet for display special cases) for your marker interface. They're easy to lookup in the catalog too - search with the object_provides key. Example of special case awesomeness: you can register a local site manager for a subtree of your site; adapters kick in only in that subtree.

The taxonomy-for-categorisation story is not so awesome. By default we have the thankfully-renamed-from-Categories Tags. The Event content type proxies this field for its event type field, which means any event type you add becomes part of the global tag bucket! The best add-on I've found is ATVocabularyManager, but that puts vocabularies into content space where they're affected by global roles e.g. a content editor can mess with the terms. Would love to hear if people have successfully used Products.Relations or lovely.tag or similar. Nowadays I am using plone.app.registry.

OK, back to Plone calling the shots: workflow is excellent. If you are not comfortable with permissions, roles, users/groups and workflow, drop everything else and read up. Martin Aspeli's ""DCWorkflow's Hidden Gems"" article is a real eye opener, revealing how workflow can solve many problem types. Get comfortable with the Sharing tab - understand how to control who has roles in a given context and what those roles mean. Tweaking permissions in context in the ZMI is usually bad, but there's an exception: granting an add permission for some content type (often your own) in a particular folder is a neat solution to the only-addable-here problem.

An example of how solving a problem the Plone way can take a little lateral thinking: Drupal has a 'promoted to homepage' flag for every node. I needed the same. First thought was archetypes.schemaextender for a custom checkbox, just like Drupal. I would need to add a custom catalog index. But after digesting Martin's article I realised 'promoted' was a state of the content, and that I could use workflow. Content could go from 'published' to 'promoted'. This was way easier! The catalog index (and Collection field) already existed. Plus I would get a record of the transition. And I was automatically able to use features like content rules to setup automatic transitions. A Eureka moment! Think about how to solve your problems in terms of Plone features.

A word on coding: when writing Drupal code you rarely look at the source of core. Instead you write hooks at the access points you've been granted. With Plone, the whole CMS is written (atop Zope) with the techniques you'll use for your custom code. This is great because there's a whole slew of code in your buildout cache you can directly learn from. Find a high level one like plone.app.portlets and figure out how it works.

Some miscellaneous tips and tricks:
- write your own helper views, just like those in plone.app.layout.globals. Add methods that describe your site-specific context e.g. are we in the part of the site that needs a custom header graphic? You can look these up from other views, including in templates. Especially useful for TAL condition one-liners e.g. in resource registry conditions.
- Find and read Kees Hink's blog post on how expiration/publication dates work. It's concise but thorough!
- If you use content for structure, but want individual items (e.g. an image that's rendered in a portlet) hidden from search results, set its expiration date to some past date.
- It's easy to conditionally load JavaScript in Plone using conditions in resource registries. You can break up your page-specific JavaScript into separate files to manage the complexity. Don't have to load all the JavaScript for every page, like you might be used to from a CMS like Drupal.
- Plone is opinionated. You will save many a headache if the site requirements are written in Plone terms. For example, I lost count of the number of times I had to explain that 'a piece of content can go through multiple workflows' translated to 'a piece of content can go through multiple workflow *states*'. Should've fixed this before we started!

In a nutshell: it's like learning a foreign language. If you try to speak French by swapping each word in an English idiom, ce n'est not going to travail. You must embrace the culture shift. Vive la diff√©rence!

The future: the great news is that all this gets easier with every release. The cruft is disappearing allowing the really useful, powerful Plone features to shine. The new stuff like the 3Ds of Dexterity, Diazo and Deco - oh and don't forget grok - is designed to make integrators' lives simpler.

The Plone technology architecture does not easily accomodate microblogging: many insertions of many small objects, and per-user dynamic real-time views do not really fit the CMS publishing paradigm.

power microblogging in Plone. Zeromq is a leading messaging framework which is
a natural fit for the message streams generated by microblogging.

The talk will place the desirability of microblogging features in a wider context.

technologies highlights the importance of microblogging as the ""missing link""
in Plone as an Enterprise 2.0 platform.

Come learn how we did it and the tips/tricks we used to get there.
","This talk will cover three topics:

1) Diazo theming workflow:
‚Äì Setting up the rules.xml file to handle complex designs
‚Äì Using Xincludes to tie together common elements across different designs
‚Äì Content type theme switching (news items, pages, custom types, etc.)

2) Theming the backend:
‚Äì Why this is just as important for you as it is your client
‚Äì Overcoming the Plone admin CSS
‚Äì Simplifying the editing interface
‚Äì Successfully incorporating customizations

3) Tips and tricks:
‚Äì Working with ‚Äî instead of against ‚Äî the XDV rules
‚Äì XPath‚Äôs power
‚Äì Setting context in your Xincludes without having access to the tag
‚Äì Setting theme-wide XPath variables to control your CMS URLs
‚Äì XPath commenting

Special note: We are hoping to have one of our developers join in this talk to provide even more depth and perspective on what we've accomplished. The co-presenter, if we can swing it, will be Dane Odekirk.

Indexing human/content co-dependency.,"This presentation will demonstrate developer and end-user add-ons for managing named human-to-content relationships. 

collective.subscribe is a library aimed at making it easy for developers to create applications indexing relationships between humans and content items.  Humans (site members, or anyone else with an email address or OpenID) can subscribe to content using named predicates such as ""like"", ""dislike"", ""follow"", ""invited"", ""confirmed attendance"" or any other arbitrary relationship.  Such relationships are indexed in a purpose-specific ""Subscription Catalog"" for use by applications needing to track them.  An example add-on demonstrating like/dislike buttons will be demonstrated along with collective.inviting, a calendar event invitations management add-on for Plone.  collective.subscribe supports any Python-based application that can use the ZODB and Zope Component Architecture, and is liberally licensed (MIT).

** Currently, these packages are unreleased and under a different set of names (currently uu.subscribe and uu.inviting).  I intend to release these July 24, 2011 to PyPI and collective repository on GitHub.  Source is currently available in Bazaar branches on launchpad.net:

But they were running on Plone 3.0 and really wanted to move forward to the latest and greatest. So we put the server on a diet. Using structure simplification, consolidation and content archiving techniques we removed 2/3rds of the site, without loosing a day in uptime. This talk will show you how we did it, with asynchronous batching and a little elbow grease.

I'll show the tricks, the tips and the lessons learned. Ready to shed some weight? Techniques used: bragging about database sizes and a lot of plone.app.async!",45 minutes,"I'm not sure.

All you need for a smart page in one step. The basis is an Article content-type, which is folderish so you can add sub-articles, images, files, etc. into it. Then you choose from a range of so called ""components"" to display content that is in your Article: listings, galleries, coverflows maps, the list goes on pretty far. For example, you can enable the ""gallery-right"" component and that will display all images in your article in a viewlet on the right side of the article. Moreover, you can reorder/hide/display any of these images with a single click on a small toolbar that is shown over each image.

Raptus Article uses Zope Component Architecture to provide it's features. Enabling a ""gallery-right"" component simply means applying one marker interface to your Article.  It's because of this design, it's fairly easy to extend current components or even add your custom ones.
