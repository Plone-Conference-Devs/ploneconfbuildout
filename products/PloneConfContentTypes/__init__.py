# There are three ways to inject custom code here:
#
#   - To set global configuration variables, create a file AppConfig.py.
#       This will be imported in config.py, which in turn is imported in
#       each generated class and in this file.
#   - To perform custom initialisation after types have been registered,
#       use the protected code section at the bottom of initialize().
